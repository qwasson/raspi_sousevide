# raspi_sousevide
Controlling a slow cooker to make a homebrew sous vide

Parts Required

Raspberry Pi
Any variant will do.  Make sure you can connect to it over a network, because you won't be able to use a TTY

Thermocouple and thermocouple amplifier

Energenie Pi-Mote and a compatible socket

GPIO Splitter (maybe)

The Pi-Mote leaves enough pins unused that you can attach the termocouple and the Pi-Mote to a single Pi at the same time.  As the Pi-Mote has a 26-pin connector, if you have an old Pi, you need a splitter.  If you have a 40-pin Pi, you might be able to attach the Pi-Mote and still have enough room at the end for the thermocouple. Be careful to not bend any pins though!
